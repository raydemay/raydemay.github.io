I had the opportunity to present about my work at [OHECC 2024](https://www.uakron.edu/ohecc/conference-schedule#navday3){:target="\_blank"} at The University of Akron.

My main focus was on Ohio State's strategy for managing Apple devices with Jamf Pro, showcasing our shared service model and some of the work I have done utilizing Azure and the Jamf Pro API. I also had the opportunity to share the Jamf side of our deployment of 802.1X certificate authentication for eduroam in a different presentation.

[Here is a link to my presentation](/assets/files/OSUSharedJamf_OHECC.pdf)

I should mention that my slide about automating Nudge is basically irrelevant because Nudge is implementing exactly what I was planning to do, but natively. My project is archived in GitHub.

Now I get to present the same thing at JNUC!
