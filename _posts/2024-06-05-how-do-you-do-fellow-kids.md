Walking back onto The Ohio State University campus as a student felt surreal – especially since it was 10 years after I'd last done it. Yep, I was a millennial in my 30s, dusting off my (very old) aerospace engineering textbooks and diving back into college life. It was a different world this time around, but I was ready to take on the challenge. Some of it was very familiar. I was in the same buildings, walking the same sidewalks, but this time, the faces around are a tad younger. Welcome to the world of being a non-traditional college student. Trust me, it's an adventure. Let's dive into the unique challenges (and rewards) of this experience.

# Learning in 2008 and in 2024

Let's be real, college life was a different beast back then. Facebook was in its infancy, iPhones were just starting to take over, and most of our learning happened in actual classrooms, not on Zoom. I remember lugging around heavy textbooks, writing things on **paper**, and slowly running my MATLAB code on my Dell Inspiron 15. Ohio State was still on the quarters system, so I had a new class schedule every 10 weeks, and the academic year was from September until June.

Fast forward almost 15 years, and the changes were mind-blowing. Lectures were recorded, assignments were submitted online, and discussions happened on virtual platforms. Ohio State was on semesters now. It was a learning curve for this old-school millennial, but I adapted. I was fine with managing thousands of iPads and deploying learning apps, but it took me some time to be comfortable with them in a classroom setting. PDF textbooks and Notability became my preferred way of studying. It turns out that understanding graphs and drawings is much easier if they are legible!

Being in classes with 18 to 22-year-olds was definitely interesting. They'd grown up with technology I was beginning to embrace, and their pop culture references often went over my head. But we connected over our shared passion for engineering, and I found myself learning as much from them as they did from me.

# The Generation Gap... Kinda

Yeah, there's an age difference between you and your classmates. You might have a mortgage and a family, they might be figuring out laundry and finding a roommate for the summer. Here's the thing: it's not as weird as you think.

- **Find Common Ground:** Don't overthink it. Bond over shared interests in classes, clubs, or just a mutual love for coffee. You'll be surprised how much you have in common beyond age.
- **Be a Mentor (If Asked):** Your life experience can be valuable. If younger students ask for advice, offer it – but don't force it. They'll appreciate your perspective.
- **Embrace the Learning:** You might pick up some new slang or discover a cool band. Be open to the exchange of knowledge, regardless of the direction it flows.

# Juggling Act: Work, Life, and Study

Balancing a full-time job with a full course load was intense, but I'd anticipated that. My time management skills were tested, but I made it work. Late nights, endless coffee, and sacrifices were par for the course, but I was determined. Here are some hard-earned tips:

- **Time Management is King:** Schedule everything. Your work hours, class times, study blocks, even breaks. A calendar is your best friend. It was especially important to have my class schedule in my work calendar so meetings didn't overlap.
- **Set Realistic Expectations:** You can't do it all. Prioritize ruthlessly. Some social events might have to take a backseat for a while. This includes scheduling classes. It might take an extra year to finish, but the workload will be more palatable.
- **Ask for Help:** Don't be afraid to reach out to professors for extensions, your boss for understanding, or even classmates for notes if you miss a lecture. Most people are supportive.
- **Celebrate Small Wins:** Finished a paper on time? Aced a midterm? Give yourself a pat on the back. Those little victories keep you going.

It really helps to have a good support system around you. Success often comes down to teamwork, both at work and at home. My manager and my wife formed an amazing team that empowered me to tackle this challenge head-on.

# Why It's All Worth It

Yes, it's tough. But pursuing your education in your 30s is an incredible investment in yourself. You're gaining knowledge, expanding your network, and proving to yourself that you can achieve your goals, no matter what life throws your way. It could be for a career change as it was for me. It could just be to accomplish something that you have always wanted to do. No matter what the goal is, the journey and the end result are worth it.

Remember: You're not alone. There are plenty of us non-traditional students out there, each with our unique stories. Embrace the journey, stay focused, and you'll rock this.

# A New Chapter

So, what's next? I'm excited to see where this aerospace engineering degree takes me. I'm ready for new challenges and opportunities, and I'm grateful for the experience of being a non-traditional student. It was a wild ride, full of challenges and triumphs, but I wouldn't trade it for anything.
