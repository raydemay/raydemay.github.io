  Swapping scripts for spaceships: A Jamf admin's journey to aerospace

I've always had a knack for solving complex problems and making intricate systems run smoothly â€“ skills I honed as an IT administrator. But my true passion lies in reaching for the stars, which is why I'm making the leap into aerospace engineering.

My goal was always to get my aerospace degree, but I never would have guessed that this was the path that I would take. I came to Ohio State as a freshman in 2008 after graduating as valedictorian from a small school in Northeast Ohio. I was woefully underprepared for college life, but I did learn something valuable. I _get_ computers. I built desktops and got comfortable doing advanced troubleshooting on my devices. I was living in off-campus housing in 2011, so I needed to figure out a way to pay for rent. I figured I could use the skills that I only recently discovered to make some money by trying to get a job as a student help desk worker. This is where my career trajectory veered off course.

I worked my way up from a help desk student employee to a full-time tier 1 in about a year, choosing to not continue pursuing my degree. I moved to desktop support two years later, got married, then through my growth at work and by increasing my skillset by building a homelab, made a leap to be a systems administrator for the College of Engineering. I took over their neglected Jamf server and helped to migrate it to the new shared cloud server that my old department was standing up. I was not an Apple expert, but I had a lot of exposure through desktop support and seemed to have a good grasp of that _other_ OS.

I experienced a lot at Engineering. **A lot.** I assisted with domain migrations and an SCCM buildout, helped implement a new computer imaging process, and kicked off OSU's relationship with Patch My PC as their first customer at the university. I also became one of the more involved Jamf admins in the shared service. Then Covid happened.

2020 was a year that would change a lot of things for a lot of people, but I am blessed that it was a change for the good in my life. IT lends itself well to remote work, but my wife is a teacher, so quarantine was a strange transition for her. Having a son that wasn't quite a year old yet also complicated things, but that time with all of us together was very special.

Then came May ~~27th~~ 30th, 2020. The day that SpaceX launched Demo-2 and re-established America's manned spaceflight capabilities. It is also the day that re-ignited my passion for spaceflight. I was so overtaken by this mission that I applied for reinstatement into the aerospace engineering major three days later. I received the good news of my acceptance on July 22nd. This was really going to happen. I did a physics and calculus crash course (shoutout to Khan Academy and MIT OpenCourseWare) and started on my journey to become an aerospace engineer... again.

Thanksgiving 2021 was another pivotal moment in my career. My old department was losing _both_ of their Jamf admins. They asked my boss if they could borrow me on a partial appointment until they filled the position, but really it was a sort of autidion. I filled the senior role as the application owner of OSU's shared Jamf service two months later.

My current role has given me more opportunity to grow my technical acumen, working with APIs and on larger projects. I run a platform used by 15+ units and have been able to improve the service and help our partners manage their Apple devices well, all while working on finishing my degree. I have implemented new processes, streamlined and automated workflows, and even presented my work at conferences. In class, I was learning about combustion instabilities, Keplerian orbital elements, PID controllers, and Euler-Bernoulli beam theory. While I worked to design a new software update process, I also worked on a design for a communications network around the Moon. I was the project lead on both of my capston teams while also being the Apple and Jamf SME for my department. Oh, and I mentioned that there were two Jamf admins that left around the same time, right? That second role wasn't filled until March 2024. I graduated a month later.

Balancing work, family, and a demanding academic schedule was no easy feat, but my determination to excel (and a healthy dose of caffeine) helped me graduate summa cum laude. Being selected for Tau Beta Pi, the top engineering honor society, was the icing on the cake! It confirmed that I'm not just a tech whiz, but also someone who has the potential to make a real difference in aerospace. My career is ready for liftoff, and I'm eager to see where this new trajectory takes me.
