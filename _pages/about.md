## ABOUT ME

As an IT administrator with a proven track record of managing complex systems and solving intricate problems, I am now seeking to transition into the dynamic field of aerospace engineering. My dedication to my craft is evident in my academic achievements; despite the challenges of balancing full-time work and family commitments, I excelled in my studies, graduating summa cum laude. My selection as a member of Tau Beta Pi, the premier engineering honor society, stands as a testament to my technical acumen and my potential for innovation in aerospace engineering. With a solid foundation in technology and a passion for continuous learning, I am ready to contribute to groundbreaking projects and drive advancements in aerospace technology.

My interests in aerospace projects are diverse and align with the latest advancements in the field. I am particularly fascinated by the Artemis Program, which aims to land the first woman and next man on the Moon, and the Dragonfly mission, which plans to send a drone-like rotorcraft to explore Saturn's moon Titan. The Europa Clipper mission is another project that captures my attention, with its goal to investigate Jupiter's moon Europa and its potential to support life. These projects not only push the boundaries of our understanding and capabilities in space exploration but also offer opportunities to apply my IT and systems management skills in new and challenging contexts.
